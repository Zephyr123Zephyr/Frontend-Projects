        <img src="image/spanishmorning.png" alt="Morning of Spanish Empire">

        <p class="article-content">In the home city interface, the capital of Japan during the Edo period presents a completely different scene. Japan, in its period of isolation, had no chance to participate in the grand navigation; however, AOE3 provides new possibilities!</p>

        <p class="article-content">The westward trains and cowboys characterize that era in the US. In AOE3, the US is a civilization characterized by immigration. By bringing in immigrants from other countries, you acquire their technologies and routes!</p>

    <section id="image11">
        <p class="article-heading">Lakota People</p>
        <img src="https://www.forgottenempires.net/wp-content/uploads/age-of-empires-3-de-lakota-1280x720.jpg" alt="Lakota People">
        <p class="article-content">Compared to European civilizations, the Native North Americans lack developed home cities, bastions, and factories. However, their bravery and wisdom make them skilled cavalry and gunmen. In AOE3, they can compete with European powers!</p>

        <img src="image/seminole.png" alt="Seminole Village">
        <p class="article-content">In addition to the playable civilizations, AOE3 also features smaller-scale civilizations on different maps. Players can establish trade relations with these civilizations to access their technologies and military power. The Seminole are indigenous people in the Georgia region, and similar native civilizations are recorded, with a total of 32 in AOE3 - truly a history book within the game.</p>

        <p class="article-heading">Zen Temple</p>
        <img src="image/zentemple.png" alt="Zen Temple">
        <p class="article-content">Another minor civilization. See that rectangle yard over there? If you build a trading post there, you can learn from Zen's wisdom to increase your economic growth, as well as recruit special martial monks to surprise your opponent. The appearance of the Zen Temple here is somewhat unusual. Perhaps this is part of the randomness of AOE3, making each game unique.</p>
